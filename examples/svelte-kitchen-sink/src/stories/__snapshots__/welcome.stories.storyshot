      Welcome to Storybook for Svelte
    </h1>
     
  
    <p>
      
    This is a UI component dev environment for your svelte app.
  
    </p>
     
  
    <p>
      
    We've added some basic stories inside the 
      <code
        class="code svelte-5n9a95"
      >
        src/stories
      </code>
       directory.
    
      <strong>
        A story is like a visual test case
      </strong>
      
    and represents a single state of one or more UI components.
    You can have as many stories as you want.
  
    </p>

    </h1>
     

  
    <p>
      
    Just like that, you can add your own components as stories.
    You can also edit those components and see changes right away.
    
      <br />
      
    (Try editing the 
      <code
        class="code svelte-5n9a95"
      >
        Button
      </code>
       component
    located at 
      <code
        class="code svelte-5n9a95"
      >
        src/stories/views/Welcome.svelte
      </code>
      .)
  
    </p>
     
  
    <p>
      
    Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app.
      <br />
      
    Have a look at the
