## Reporting a Vulnerability

We rely on NPM's security advisory process for reporting vulnerabilities.

You can submit a vulnerability in a Storybook package at: https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report

You can also reach out to the maintainers directly on Twitter: https://twitter.com/storybookjs

When we fix a security issue, we will post a security advisory on Github/NPM, describe the change in the [release notes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/releases), and also announce notify the community on [our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UUt2PJb).
