To use auto-detected controls with Vue, you must fill in the `component` field in your story metadata:

```ts
import { Button } from './Button.vue';

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
};
```

Storybook uses this to auto-generate the `ArgTypes` for your component using [`vue-docgen-api`](https://github.com/vue-styleguidist/vue-styleguidist/tree/dev/packages/vue-docgen-api). It supports `props`, `events`, and `slots` as first class prop types.
