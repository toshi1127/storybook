Here are some answers to frequently asked questions. If you have a question, you can ask it by opening an issue on the [Storybook Repository](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/).

### How can I run coverage tests with Create React App and leave out stories?

Create React App does not allow providing options to Jest in your `package.json`, however you can run `jest` with commandline arguments:

```sh
npm test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='["src/**/*.{js,jsx}","!src/**/stories/*"]'
```

### I see `ReferenceError: React is not defined` when using storybooks with Next.js

Next automatically defines `React` for all of your files via a babel plugin. You must define `React` for JSX to work. You can solve this either by:

1.  Adding `import React from 'react'` to your component files.
2.  Adding a `.babelrc` that includes [`babel-plugin-react-require`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-require)

### How do I setup Storybook to share Webpack configuration with Next.js?

You can generally reuse webpack rules by placing them in a file that is `require()`-ed from both your `next.config.js` and your `.storybook/main.js` files. For example:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpackFinal: async (baseConfig) => {
    const nextConfig = require('/path/to/next.config.js');

    // merge whatever from nextConfig into the webpack config storybook will use
    return { ...baseConfig };
  },
};
```

### How do I setup React Fast Refresh with Storybook?

Fast refresh is an opt-in feature that can be used in Storybook React.
There are two ways that you can enable it, go ahead and pick one:

* You can set a `FAST_REFRESH` environment variable in your `.env` file:
```
FAST_REFRESH=true
```

* Or you can set the following properties in your `.storybook/main.js` files:
```js
module.exports = {
  reactOptions: {
    fastRefresh: true,
  }
};
```

**Note: Fast Refresh requires React 16.10 or higher and is only enabled in development mode.**

### Why is there no addons channel?

A common error is that an addon tries to access the "channel", but the channel is not set. This can happen in a few different cases:

1.  You're trying to access addon channel (e.g. by calling `setOptions`) in a non-browser environment like Jest. You may need to add a channel mock:
    ```js
    import addons, { mockChannel } from '@storybook/addons';

    addons.setChannel(mockChannel());
    ```

2.  In React Native, it's a special case that's documented in [#1192](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/1192)

### Can I modify React component state in stories?

Not directly. If you control the component source, you can do something like this:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default {
  title: 'MyComponent',
};

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      someVar: 'defaultValue',
      ...props.initialState,
    };
  }
  // ...
};

export const defaultView = () => <MyComponent initialState={} />;
```


### Why aren't Controls visible in the Canvas panel but visible in the Docs panel?

If you're adding Storybook's dependencies manually, make sure you to include the [`@storybook/addon-controls`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/addon-controls) dependency in your project and reference it in your `.storybook/main.js` as follows:

```js
// .storybook/main.js

module.exports = {
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-controls'],
};
```

### Why aren't the addons working in a composed Storybook?

Composition is a new feature that we released with version 6.0 and there's still some limitations to it.

For now the addons you're using in a composed Storybook will not work.

We're working on overcoming this limitation, soon you'll be able to use them  as if you working with a non composed Storybook.

### Why i'm getting errors with react-popper and Storybook?

If you're using the `react-popper` in your own project and you're experiencing issues with Storybook. You can solve them by adding the `--no-dll` command line flag. Take a look at the [cli options page](../api/cli-options.md) to see how you can use the flag in your project.

### Which community addons are compatible with the latest version of Storybook?

Starting with Storybook version 6.0 we've introduced some great features aimed at streamlining your development workflow.

With this we would like to point out that if you plan on using addons created by our fantastic community, you need to take in consideration that some of those addons might be working with a outdated version of Storybook. 

We're actively working in providing a better way to address this situation, but in the meantime we would ask a bit of caution on your end so that you don't run into unexpected problems. Let us know by creating a issue in the [Storybook repo](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues) so that we can gather information and create a curated list with those addons to help not only you but the rest of the community.

### Is it possible to browse the documentation for past versions of Storybook?

With the release of version 6.0, we also updated our documentation as well. That doesn't mean that the old documentation was removed, we kept it to help you with your Storybook migration process. Use the content from the table below in conjunction with our <a href="https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md">migration guide</a> .

We're only covering version 5.3 and 5.0 as they were important milestones for Storybook. If you want to go back in time a little more you'll have to check the specific release in the monorepo.

<div class="aside">
With the release of version 5.3 we've updated how you can write your stories to a more compact and easier way. It doesn't mean that the <code>storiesOf</code> format has been removed. For the time being we're still supporting it and we have documentation for it. But be advised that this is bound to change in the future.
