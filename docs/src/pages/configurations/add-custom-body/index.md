Sometimes, you may need to add different tags to the HTML body. This is useful for adding some custom content roots.

You can do this very easily. Simply create a file called `preview-body.html` inside the Storybook config directory and add tags like this:

```html
<div id="custom-root"></div>
```

That's it. Storybook will inject these tags to html body.

> **Important**
>
> Storybook will inject these tags to the iframe where your components are rendered. So, these wonâ€™t be loaded into the main Storybook UI.
